    "# Introduction and Motivation #\n",
    "Our main data-set is 'Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes of New York City(NYC)'. The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.<a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95\" >[1]</a> We found this data-set a good fit for our final project, because it has some overlapping features with the Police Department Incident Reports data-set we have worked on a lot, so we can apply many methods and techniques we learned in the exercises. By the way, there is also some other interesting features we can explore with our own imaginations. In addition to this, all of us are quite concerned about the public safety and find it interesting to learn more about traffic problems in big cities such as NYC. We would like to provide readers some insights about when, where and why motor vehicle collisions happen in NYC, the impact of these terrible collisions and the approaches we can do to protect ourselves from being in danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the basic data analysis to help our readers to get an overview of the data-set, we have our story telling focus on the cyclists perspective. As all of us enjoy cycling a lot and so do many living in Denmark, we would like to investigate the severeness of motor vehicle collisions have on the cyclists and to see the trend and offer possible suggestions. We also included other data-sets such as 'Manhattan Bike Counts 2005-2015' and 'Cycling in the city - Cycling trends in NYC - 2018' to do investigations in depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure the viewers of our website have a pleasant experience, we decided to use $\\textbf{Interactive Slideshow}$ as our genre. Our goal is to make our deliverables both author-driven and reader-driven. For example, the website will contain messages from the author to bring some insights to readers. This is beneficial for readers to understand the story behind visualizations. To not make our readers bored, we encourage them to explore graphs with interactive legends, zoom in maps and use layer controller at the upper right corner of maps to see more details. Some of our visualizations will automatically play. When the play is to the end, our readers can navigate to see specific scenes(visualizations at specific time) by dragging progress bar at the right bottom of maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Stats#\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data-set consists of 1407835(1407831 with at least one variable available) rows and 29 variables/columns. The motor vehicle collisions were recorded from 2012 to 2021 as we downloaded the latest version. Cases recorded distribute in 5 boroughs in NYC and they are Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. We printed some basic stats in the following cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "We had our distribution of collision cases by years, months, days, hours and minutes on one graph. The graph is with 5 different available time units. We neglected other time units and focused on only one specific time unit at each time. This data pre-processing and cleaning work enabled us to investigate 5 unique trends and think more about, for example, why collisions boosted in some specific years, hours and minutes. We also had our distribution of different boroughs and different types of people injured/killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that more than two vehicles enrolled in one collision. Actually the data-set mostly reported 5 vehicles in one collision. We are curious about will the contributing factors and vehicle types vary from different vehicles. Therefore, we made 5 vehicles as our interactive legends. As there is many different contributing factors and vehicle types reported, we only took the top5 and top10 respectively. The data cleaning is done for top5 and top10 can sufficiently report the mainstream and we are not care about some very rare and extreme cases. We also normalized the value for a pleasant visualization and comparison. The total number of cases for 5 vehicles is quite different because most of crashes only involved two or three vehicles. Instead of taking the exact value, we took the probability of the distribution for each vehicle in the legend.   "

    "## Number of motor vehicle collisions by different time units ##\n",
    "We can conclude that there is no significant difference between months and days regarding the number of cases. There is fewer cases on the 31$^{\\text{st}}$ because not all months have 31 days. There is a bit fewer cases happening in April, May and June. Most of the motor collisions were recorded between 2015 and 2019. Most of the cases occurred in the afternoon, between 14 and 18, with maximum in 16 and 17. At these time intervals, most of people are off work and rush to go back home, causing intense pressure of the traffic and that can be the reason for the boosting of motor collisions. We found it interesting that minutes recorded are mostly round numbers, for example, 0, 5, 10, 15... Police officers might keep the habit of keeping round minutes and that can correspond to people's common habits of telling time. "

    "Unlike the distribution of contributing factors, the distribution of vehicle types are basically the same with vehicles sharing different priorities of accident liability. For vehicles enrolled in crashes, no matter if it is the one sharing main liability (Vehicle 1) or the one sharing the least liability (Vehicle 5), they exert the large probability that they are station wagon/sport utility vehicle(SUV) or sedans. They are also likely to be passenger vehicle with many passengers on board. It seems that vehicles with good utility are more likely to collide, because these vehicles can accelerate within short time, be with heavy self weight and be hard to pull over. Therefore, we strongly suggest drivers of SUV, sedans(especially 4-dr) and passenger vehicle to pay more attention to the road condition in order to bring less damage."

The counts have been conducted along designated bicycle routes at 10 on-street and 5 off-street locations during the fall season. These locations have remained generally consistent.<a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-bikecounts.page\" >[2]</a>\n",

    " \n",
    " - Months: The reported season for bike counts is fall, therefore we only took cases occurring in September, October and November from collision data-set.\n",

There is also a large volume of cyclists passing by this crossroads according to cyclists count at the monitoring spot. We strongly suggest cyclists to be cautious around this spot and pay attention to the road condition. \n",
    "     - The injured/killed cyclists are also severe around Fifth Avenue at 14 St., more specifically, at the crossroads of Fifth Avenue and 14th Street. However the volume of total cyclists are smaller than Sixth Avenue at W23 St., indicating that this spot is even more dangerous than the crossroads of Sixth Avenue and West 23rd Street. Cyclists should also pay a lot of attention around this spot.  \n",
    "     - Route 9A at 11th St., which is at the West Street and at the bank of Hudson river, should be a safe place for cyclists. Because the volume of cyclists is the largest among all monitoring spots but the reported harm is quite few. We recommend cyclists to make their commuting route pass by this spot if possible. Because this action might save their time and keep them safe in rush hours. It might also help to reduce the traffic pressure in the center of the city.  \n",
    "2. Weekend of 2015 fall\n",
    "    - There is more cyclists at the west bank of Hudson river than the east bank at weekends. \n",
    "    - Both banks of hudson river can be good cycling spots at weekends, as there is quite few reported injured/killed cyclists by vehicle collisions. West bank is extremely safe for its large volume of cyclists with barely no reported cases. \n",
    "    - The gathering of injured/killed changes to south of Manhattan a bit at weekends of 2015 fall. Many citizens' work places seem to be situated in the center of Manhattan, causing more traffic pressure in the center on weekdays than at weekends. However, many people might reside to the south of the city center. Therefore, more collisions will harm cyclists at weekends in the south of Manhattan.  \n",
    "3. Weekday of 2014 fall\n",
    "    - Lafayette Street at Astor Pl.,Fifth Avenue at 14 St. and Broadway at W28 St. are the most dangeous spots for cyclists, judging from the total number of cyclists passing by is relatively small but a large number of injured/killed cyclists are reported in the motor vehicle collision data-set.\n",
    "4. Weekend of 2014 fall\n",
    "    - The insight is quite similar to the weekend of 2015 fall.  \n",
    "\n",

We only took where 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1' is 'Bike' in the collision data-set for this indicates cyclists took the main accident liability. According to the pre-processing result, we have known the top5 contributing factors of biker's mistake.\n",

    "We decided to apply K-Nearest-Neighborhood(KNN) to classify these top5 contributing factors and visualize them on map. We used all observations we have to fit KNN classifier and created a $50 \\times 50$ grid to map main streets we have investigated before. The observations we have is for training and the grid dots is to apply the trained KNN classifier and can be regarded as test set. We used 5-Nearest-Neighborhood to classify top5 contributing factors on map.  "

    "We think we balance the story telling to be both author-driven and reader-driven well. We wrote a large amount of text to help readers understand our insight well. Many visualizations we made allow users to interact with them. Readers can also have fun by exporing visualizations themself. We used many good tools to improve the user experience, for example, interactive legends from Bokeh package, layer controller and progress bar for heatmap with time from folium package. \n",
    " \n",
    "We also successfully have our story telling focus on cyclists safety while providing readers with the overview of the entire motor vehicle collisions data-set. Our users can know the distribution of key variables of the data-set by looking at Basic Stats. Meanwhile, they are also able to acquire much information about which spots and steets might be dangerous for cyclists. Further on, they will know how cyclists can do to keep themself from bicycle collisions by looking at Machine Learning Analysis. The advice is quite detailed, even specified at different segments of main streets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We combined data analysis, machine learning and data visualization well. Our deliverables were based on a large amount of data-cleaning and pre-processing work, application of machine learning algorithms and application of a large variety of visualization packages and tools. Our approach might be technical and complicated but users can easily learn our insight from visualizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We tried our best to find other resources on the internet to assist our story telling. Apart from the main vehicle collisions data-set, we used 2 other data-sets with cyclists count reported. One of them is initially reported in a pdf file and we transferred the data to csv manually. We found them relevant, because it is hard to tell how dangerous a place is only by referring to the quantity of injured/killed cyclists. We also need to know the cyclists volume to make our judgement. It makes no sense to tell a place is dangerous where the reported harm is a bit much but the cyclists volume is extremely large. We ensure our readers can be awere of the cyclists volume of different monitoring spots and streets by marking them on maps with different sizes of markers. They can also see the intensity of places concerning injured/killed cyclists with heatmap. The comparison seems to make our suggestions quite persuasive. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvement ##\n",
    "\n",
    "We might need to have more types of graphs apart from bar plots and visualizations on map. We can also involve more statistical modelling to explain our insight. We can try finding more data resources online with better continuity, therefore we can know more about which months, seasons and years are with better cyclists safety. "
